# ETHIO Safeguard - System Requirements Specification

## 1. Project Overview
**Project:** ETHIO Safeguard - Fault-Tolerant Distributed System for Real-Time Aid Delivery Tracking  
**Goal:** Transform aid logistics from reactive/opaque to proactive/transparent in remote Ethiopian regions

## 2. Core Problems Addressed
1. Inefficient Routing: Vehicles taking suboptimal routes  
2. Lack of Accountability: Difficulty verifying aid delivery  
3. Resource Duplication: Multiple organizations sending aid to same location  
4. Delayed Response: No proactive dispatch for broken-down vehicles  

## 3. User Personas
